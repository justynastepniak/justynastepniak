### Summary

This case study, part of the Google "Data Analytics Professional Certificate" capstone project, focuses on Bellabeat, a successful health-focused products manufacturer for women. The goal is to answer key business questions and inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy by analyzing smart device usage data. Bellabeat's diverse product line includes the Bellabeat app, Leaf (wellness tracker), Time (wellness watch), Spring (smart water bottle), and a subscription-based membership program. The marketing analytics team aims to identify trends in smart device usage, apply these trends to Bellabeat customers, and influence the company's marketing strategy accordingly. The primary data source is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, obtained through a 2016 survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, containing information on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring from 30 respondents. However, the dataset has limitations, such as a small sample size, lack of demographic information, and outdated data. Despite these constraints, the case study seeks to derive valuable insights to refine Bellabeat's marketing strategy and uncover potential market opportunities.
