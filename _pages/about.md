### About me

I am a data analyst with background in graphic design & quality assurance.
I acquired expertise through independent learning and hands-on experience. My knowledge is largely self-directed, gained through a combination of online courses, practical application, and continuous exploration.
When it comes to working with data, I bring to the table a knack for **storytelling**, **visualisation** and **translating complex datasets** into compelling narratives, making the information accessible and meaningful to a wider audience.
